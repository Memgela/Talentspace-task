## How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I spent about 6 hours. If I had more time, I would improve the `signIn` command. I'd implement it by adding a token right into the localStorage.
It took about 3 hours trying to fix chrome bug because of which the registration test was failing every first run of tests. Somewhat the very first run registration takes about minute to get response and redirect to the app.

## What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?

## How would you approach adding automated testing to an existing (web) application with no existing E2E tests? Have you ever had to do this?

I have never had to do this. I would start with the most critical parts of the application, for example, registration, authentication, payment, billing, etc. Then cover with tests other parts of the app in priority order.
